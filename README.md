# CGBA_React-Redux_Milestone
Creating a social media app consisting of three pages. Page one - home page, Two - News Feed, Three - User Search


Sample Project Description:

We will be creating a social media app consisting of three pages. Page one will be our home
page, this will use Semantic UI React to create a signup page and login page. The sign up page
section will also take in user data such as age, gender, and favorite activities. Once the user is
signed in, it will lead to a newsfeed page. We will be using the jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
API to populate the newsfeed with random posts from other users. Our third page will be a user
search page. By entering a user id, our user will be able to view the profile of themselves as well
as other registered users!
